      <h2>Researching Rijksmuseum website</h2>

      <p>During this project my team focused on research in design – in the products that are already made. This project was about one of the most popular museum’s website in the Netherlands – <a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl">Rijksmuseum.nl.</a> The aim was to research user’s opinion and experience about the website – content, usability and usefulness. During user trialling we were going to give users some simple and difficult tasks to see how users are interacting with the website, how easily can the user find something or store information. We were interviewing users after the observation to gather insights about their opinion  Our goal was to research, analyse the data and write a report about the usability of the website and the user’s opinion.</p>

      <h3>Steps that we went through:</h3>
      <h4>Research set-up and pilot testings</h4>
      <p>
      <h4>Improving the set-up</h4>
      <h4>Conducting user trials</h4>
      <h4>Analysing data</h4>
