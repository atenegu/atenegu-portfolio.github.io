    <h2>Bespoke card personalization tool and digital unwrapping</h2>
    <h4>Project made by me and Karol Liman</h4>
    <p>The bespoke project is in collaboration with a famous card company Hallmark. As more and more people choose to study or live abroad from their home countries, many of them lack devotedness with their relatives, especially during various celebrations as Christmas or birthdays. That is why intangible gifts become more popular, although it is hard to think of a way to "present" the gift in a personal way. The goal is to design a card personalization tool as well as the card and the digital unwrapping experience tailored for our user based on his needs and preferences to give him the best gifting experience. </p>
    <p>The Card personalization tool was designed for the user as a giver. His gifting experience was designed for his best friend with an emotional message to express his loyalty, care and most importantly - fun. He put a lot of energy, as the gifting experience is well thought and personalized. Making gift giving experience is based on relatedness – willingness to make them feel the same as they do, in this case - entertained, narrative – including memories from the past and creativity, as Jordan loves to feel creative and challenged while making something tailored. </p>

    <p id="persona">Persona was made out of two user portraits. We used many quotes as they remind us about the characteristics and make the persona more authentic. Icons make the persona playful and coherent.</p>

    <p id="pp">I was making the card personalization tool which we called "Monster maker". My aim was to make a "quick and dirty" prototype, so that I would have more time for testing and making hi-fi prototype. The paper prototype looked like this:</p>

  </div>
  </div>

<div class="mm">
    <p>Digital prototype of the "Monster maker" was created with Adobe XD. Even though the app should let the user create his own version of monster and place the body parts anywhere, prototype has only one outcome, but differet sequences of body parts placement.</p>
