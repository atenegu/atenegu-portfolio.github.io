    <h3>Bepoke project</h3>
    <p>The bespoke project is in collaboration with a famous card company Hallmark. As more and more people choose to study or live abroad from their home countries, many of them lack devotedness with their relatives, especially during various celebrations as Christmas or birthdays. That is why intangible gifts become more popular, although it is hard to think of a way to "present" the gift in a personal way. The goal is to design a card personalization tool as well as the card and the digital unwrapping experience tailored for our user based on his needs and preferences to give him the best gifting experience.<a class="btn-projects" href="bespoke.html"> More...</a> </p>

    <h3 id="rd-in">Research in design</h3>
    <p>During this project my team focused on research in design – in the products that are already made. This project was about one of the most popular museum’s website in the Netherlands – <a class="rijks" href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl" target="_blank">Rijksmuseum.nl.</a> The aim was to research user’s opinion and experience about the website – content, usability and usefulness. During user trialling we were going to give users some simple and difficult tasks to see how users are interacting with the website, how easily can the user find something or store information. We were interviewing users after the observation to gather insights about their opinion. Our goal was to research, analyse the data and write a report about the usability of the website and the user’s opinion.</p>
